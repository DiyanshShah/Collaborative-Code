Timeline for a First Version (MVP)

Let's be realistic and define a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The goal is not to build every feature we discussed, but to build the core experience to prove the concept.

MVP Features:

    User registration and login.

    Ability to create a new project "room."

    Share a URL to invite others to the room.

    A single shared code editor where collaborators can see each other's typing in real-time.

A realistic timeline for a solo developer with experience in this stack is about 6 to 8 weeks. Here's a plausible breakdown:

    Week 1: Project Setup & Foundations

        Set up your project repositories (frontend/backend).

        Get your Fastify server running with basic API endpoints.

        Set up your PostgreSQL database schema for users and projects.

        Implement user registration and login functionality.

    Week 2: The Editor Interface

        Integrate the Monaco Editor into your React frontend.

        Build the basic UI: the main editor view, a simple header, and login/dashboard pages.

        Set up project "rooms" on the backend so a user can create or join a session.

    Weeks 3-4: The Real-time Core

        This is the most challenging part.

        Integrate Socket.IO into your Fastify server and React client.

        Set up the Y.js library on both the client and server.

        Connect Y.js to the Monaco Editor so local changes are tracked.

        Use Socket.IO to broadcast the Y.js updates to all other clients in the same room.

        Spend significant time debugging to ensure synchronization is smooth and bug-free.

    Week 5: Polish & User Experience

        Implement presence indicators (e.g., showing a list of users currently in the room).

        Allow users to see the cursors of other collaborators.

        Refine the UI/UX for inviting users and managing projects.

    Week 6: Deployment & Testing

        Prepare your application for deployment (using environment variables for secrets).

        Deploy all services to Render.

        Conduct end-to-end testing on the live environment.

        Fix bugs related to the production environment (e.g., WebSocket connection issues, CORS policies).

This timeline is ambitious but achievable. It requires focused effort. If you are learning some of these technologies for the first time, you should realistically expect the process to take longer.
